  /**
   * \brief Defines if and how a unit is shown on the minimap.
   * 
   * Following values are known to work:
   * 
   * - 0 does not place a dot on the mini-map. Eye candy, resources, 
   *     fish traps, OUTLWs, and farms have this value
   * - 1 places a square dot on the min-map for the unit. When the unit is 
   *     selected, the dot will turn white
   * - 2 places a diamond-shaped dot on the mini-map for the unit. When the unit 
   *     is selected, the dot will turn white
   * - 3 places a diamond-shaped dot on the mini-map for the unit. When the unit 
   *     is selected, the dot remains the player's color.
   * - 4 places a larger black spot on the minimap which does not follow the 
   *     unit. Whenever you open the chat box (enter) and close it, the black 
   *     spots will move to the unit on the minimap. No blinking occurs when 
   *     the unit is attacked. Both allied and enemy units are visible in the 
   *     black area on the minimap. CLF units have this value and a brown spot
   *     is placed instead.
   * - 5 does the same thing as “4”
   * - 6 does not place a dot on the minimap
   * - 7-9 does the same thing as “6”
   * - 10 does the same thing as “6”. Hawks, macaws, and flying dogs have 
   *      this value.
